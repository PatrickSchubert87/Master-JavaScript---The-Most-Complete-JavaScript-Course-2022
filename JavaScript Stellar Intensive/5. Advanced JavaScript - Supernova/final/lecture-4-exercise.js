/*And we would like to create another class Rabbit.

As rabbits are animals, Rabbit class should be based on Animal class
so this class must have access to all of the animal methods/

The syntax to extend another class is: Child extends Parent Class.
1) So you need to create class Rabbit that inherits from Animal:
2) Need to add another property for the Rabbit and that is number of legs
3) Object of Rabbit class needs another method called hide
this method will use the name that was set in the parent class
and and say for example: "The White Rabbit has 4 legs but now wants to hide!"
So the output should be something like this
AnimalÂ {name: "Animal"}
The White Rabbit runs with speed 5 km/h.
The White Rabbit has 4 legs but now wants to hide!!
let rabbit = new Rabbit("The White Rabbit",4);
rabbit.setSpeed(5);
rabbit.run();
rabbit.hide();
